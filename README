cdoc is a perldoc-like documentation tool for C.

It is very simple to use. Basically you just need to add the following
in front of your function prototypes in header files:

/* Function: foo - foobar a baz
 * Function: foo_p
 *
 * The @code{foo} function foobars a baz. It takes one parameter, the
 * pointer to the @code{baz} structure.
 *
 * @code{foo_p} returns true if the parameter @code{baz} has been foobarred.
 *
 * See also: @ref{baz(3)}, @ref{frobnicate(3)}.
 */
extern void foo (baz *);
extern int foo_p (baz *);

More advanced examples of the syntax can be found in the c2lib, pthrlib
and other packages at http://www.annexia.org/freeware/

To turn your header files into manpages, type: cdoc *.h
